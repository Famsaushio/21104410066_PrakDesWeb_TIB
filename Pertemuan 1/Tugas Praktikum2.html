    <p align="justify">It all happened so abruptly. 
        After finally grasping my situation, I found myself in an entirely different world. 
        Looking around, I noticed others in the same predicament… 
        Could this possibly be one of those Hero developments?<br>
        Was there a tyrannical Demon Lord needing extermination, 
        or would I be tossed into the maelstrom of war? Whatever it was, I was afraid. 
        I never wanted to be a Hero. 
        I don't want to harm another…… 
        Ignore the nonsense I was spouting; there was nothing to fret over.<br>
        The Demon Lord was slain a thousand years ago, and 800 years had passed since the last war.

        the Celestial World's Divine Races, 
        and the Mortal World's Human Races, are kind neighbours. 
        Here, everyone lives a peaceful and fulfilling life.<br>  
        In summary, this other world was――at peace.   
        What's my plan for the future? For my limited stay here,
        I will live this world to its fullest; 
        going on a cultural exchange, sightseeing, then, after experiencing the festival that is only held once every ten years, …… 
        I shall safely return home.
        However, despite my lust for a peaceful last year before returning, 
        this planet's heavyweights have begun amassing around me, and……<br>
